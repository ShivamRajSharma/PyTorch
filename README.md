# PyTorch

In this repository, you will find projects related to Natural Language Processing, Speech, and Computer Vision, implemented using PyTorch. I have provided detailed instructions on how to run each individual project on your local machine. Before running any project make sure you do install the requirements.txt to meet all the python packages dependencies.

To make the models train quicker on your local machine make sure you have CUDA and CUDNN preinstalled.

NOTE: All the models of each project were trained either on RTX 2060 or on Kaggle.

## Requirements

To install all the python packages required for the projects, run the command mentioned below on your terminal/command prompt.

``` pip install -r requirements.txt ```
