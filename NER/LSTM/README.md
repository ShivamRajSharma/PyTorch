Named-entity recognition (NER) (also known as (named) entity identification, entity chunking, and entity extraction) 
is a subtask of information extraction that seeks to locate and classify named entities mentioned in unstructured text into pre-defined 
categories such as person names, organizations, locations, medical codes, time expressions, quantities, monetary values, percentages, etc. </br>

In this repository we train a simple GRU based recurrent nueral network for Part-Of-Speech application from scratch, achieving good results even with a small network.

## Dataset Information 

The model was trained on NER dataset from kaggle. The dataset contains a total of 47k sentences with a total of 41 POS tags  . </br>
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/abhinavwalia95/entity-annotated-corpus

## Usage 

1) Install the required libraries mentioned in requirement.txt.
2) Download the dataset from url provided above and place it inside ``` input/ ``` folder.
3) Run ```python3 train.py``` and let the model train for 2-3 iterations.
4) To infer on the trained model run ```python3 predict.py```.
