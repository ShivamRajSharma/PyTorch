## Introduction 

A CAPTCHA is a type of challengeâ€“response test used in computing to determine whether or not the user is human.This form of CAPTCHA requires someone to correctly evaluate and enter a sequence of letters or numbers perceptible in a distorted image displayed on their screen. CAPTCHAs are used by any website that wishes to restrict usage by bots. For eg CAPTCHAs can prevent poll skewing by ensuring that each vote is entered by a human and many.

The overwhelming benefit of CAPTCHA is that it is highly effective against all but the most sophisticated bad bots. However, with the recent development of the neural networks in the field of computer vision, these CAPTCHAs can be easily decoded and bypassed requiring a more stronger method to classify a bot and a human.
